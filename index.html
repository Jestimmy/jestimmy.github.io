    <h1>CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING</h1>

    <h2>Cryptocurrency - meaning and definition</h2>
    <p>Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuing or regulating authority, instead using a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.</p>
    <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
    <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It’s a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets. Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety. The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was founded in 2009 and remains the best known today. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.</p>
    <h2>How does cryptocurrency work?</h2>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders.

        Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets.
        
        If you own cryptocurrency, you don’t own anything tangible. What you own is a key that allows you to move a record or a unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party.
        
        Although Bitcoin has been around since 2009, cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain technology are still emerging in financial terms, and more uses are expected in the future. Transactions including bonds, stocks, and other financial assets could eventually be traded using the technology.</p>
        <h2>Cryptocurrency examples</h2>
        <p>There are thousands of cryptocurrencies that can be mined using your mobile phone, tablet, PC provided they have good internet connection. Some of the best known include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pi Network</li>
            <li>Ice Network</li>
            <li>Over Protocol</li>

        <h2>PI Network</h2>
    <img src="./images/Pi logo.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" alt="Image showing pi logo">
<p>The vision of Satoshi Nakamoto that created Bitcoin was to create a decentralized digital currency that is widely adopted and accepted for peer-to-peer transactions. But Bitcoin's requirement of heavy energy-consuming computational power to mine has not only made it almost impossible for the ordinary person to mine. The limitation of 21 million coins to ever be mined has also astronomically pushed up its price out of the reach of many making it difficult to acquire.
    These have made Bitcoin only a store of value, albeit an unstable one, rather than a currency, therefore, defeating its original purpose. And these are what the Pi Network intends to solve with the introduction of the PiCoin.
    Pi Network introduces the very first cryptocurrency that can be mined with a smartphone, making it not only eco-friendly but accessible and readily available to millions of every day individuals all over the world to get a slice.
    Little wonder why over 21 million people around the world are already on board this fast-growing cryptocurrency project.
    Did you miss out on Bitcoin when it was newly launched?
    Have you been wondering if it is possible to ever mine cryptocurrency with your smartphone?
    Are you fascinated by cryptocurrency and would like to be part of a crypto project before it is launched?
    If you answered Yes to any or all of the above questions, then the Pi Network is exactly what you need. Want to know more about Pi network? Visit their website <a href="https://minepi.com/" target="_blank">https://minepi.com</a></p>
